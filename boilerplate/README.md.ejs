# Development

## Setup

To install node modules, fastlane (via bundler) and flow types (via flow-types):

```
yarn
```

Install iOS certificates using Fastlane Match:

```
yarn signing
```

You'll need the Fastlane Match passphrase if this is the first time on this machine.

To get Detox tests running (end to end iOS tests) you'll also need to follow the
instructions in their getting started guide:

```
brew tap facebook/fb
export CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO && brew install fbsimctl --HEAD
npm install -g detox-cli
```

Ensure you have a version of Node installed that supports async/await (7+ I think)

## Commands

Open the ios project in xcode:

```
yarn xcode
```

Run the development bundle server:

```
yarn start
```

Sometimes there is an issue with the cache leading to modules not resolving, you can clear the cache with:

```
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

Run the storybook server:

```
yarn storybook
```

To generate the storyshot test files:

```
yarn generate-storyshots
```

Run jest, flow and detox once:

```
yarn test
```

Run them individually:

```
yarn jest
yarn flow
yarn detox
```

You can also run the build and test parts of detox separately:

```
yarn detox-build
yarn detox-test
```


Run just fast tests (eg not detox):

```
yarn test-quick
```

Run flow, jest and detox watchers:

```
yarn watch-flow
yarn watch-flow
yarn watch-detox
```


Increment version number then build and push to Apple Testflight and Google Play Store Alpha Channel:

```
yarn release
```


# I18n

Translation files are in `src/i18n/locales` but new ones must be referenced from `src/i18n/index.js`.

To update the translation files with placeholders for missing translations run:

```
yarn update-locales
