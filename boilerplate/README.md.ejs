# Development

## Setup

To install node modules, fastlane (via bundler) and flow types (via flow-types):

```
yarn
```

Install iOS certificates using Fastlane Match:

```
yarn signing
```

You'll need the Fastlane Match passphrase if this is the first time on this machine.

## Commands

Open the ios project in xcode:

```
yarn xcode
```

Run the development bundle server:

```
yarn start
```

Sometimes there is an issue with the cache leading to modules not resolving, you can clear the cache with:

```
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

Run the storybook server:

```
yarn storybook
```

To generate the storyshot test files:

```
yarn generate-storyshots
```

Run all tests once:

```
yarn test
```

Run them individually:

```
yarn jest
yarn flow
```

Run test watchers:

```
yarn watch-flow
yarn watch-flow
```

Increment version number then build and push to Apple Testflight and Google Play Store Alpha Channel:

```
yarn release
```
